# **Overview (2 pts)**

A high-level summary that your classmates, and more importantly, your client (faculty member), should understand. It should be no more than 3 paragraphs.


# **Context (1 pt)**

A description of the problem at hand, why this project is necessary and what people need to know to assess this project.


# **Goals & Non-Goals (1 pt)**

Goals should:
describe how the user will benefit from your project 
specify how you will measure success
Non-Goals are equally important to describe which problems you won’t be fixing so everyone is on the same page.


# **Proposed Solution (2 pts)**

Walk through a user experience to formalize your solution. Feel free to include many sub-sections and diagrams. Diagrams can include hand-drawn pics you take a photo of with your phone. This doesn’t have to be fancy. Flowchart symbols may be useful, but not required. Provide a big picture first, then fill in lots of details. Aim for a world where you can write this, then take a vacation off the grid, and another member of the team can just read it and implement the solution as you described.This section will vary based upon the type of solution you are developing. For instance, database development would include lists of tables and data stored. A web interface would focus on the page(s) to be developed and walk-through a ‘typical’ user (use case). For analysis pipelines, walk through the steps of the analysis; existing tools used must be listed with their dependencies and careful attention must be paid to inputs/outputs of existing tools. Tasks should be ranked in order of their importance. This will help you set your milestones and determine what tasks should be tackled first.

# **Milestones (2 pts)**
A list of measurable checkpoints. This is essential to determine if you are on-track to complete the project or if you are falling behind. My recommendation: determine your milestones after you have written the rest of your design doc. Weekly milestones are recommended as they will keep your team on task. Your team’s milestones will also be highlighted in your initial group presentation.
